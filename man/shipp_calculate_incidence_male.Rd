\arguments{
\item{options}{Naomi model options.}

\item{male_srb}{MSM and PWID adjusted estimated of male SRB groups generated by \code{shipp_adjust_sexbehav_msm_pwid()}.}

\item{male_logit_prevalence}{Risk adjusted estimates of male HIV prevalence in sexual risk groups generated by \code{shipp_calculate_prevalence_male()}.}

\item{survey_year}{Survey year to sample from the SAE model. Default is 2018. Survey year should be updated to most current household survey in the country - for countries without recent household surveys, leave at 2018 - the spatiotemporal
model of sexual behaviour fitted to all countries has the most data for in roughly 2018.}
