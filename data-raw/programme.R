#' ## Malawi HIV Programme data
#'
#' Data sources from Integrated Quarterly Reporting spreadsheets available via:

#'    have been generated by facility staff and that were verified from primary
#'    records during quarterly National HIV Program Supervision (coordinated of the
#'    Department of HIV and AIDS). While every effort is made to ensure high data
#'    quality, individual records may not be complete and accurate.
