These files are alternative testing and demonstration files representing subnational Spectrum files. Three Spectrum PJNZ files werecreated based on the Malawi 2019 PJNZ file.

Region codes in .PJN files manually changed as follows:

* Northern Region: code 10
* Central Region: code 11
* Southern Region: code 12

Datasets are also created for zone-level programme data inputs for efficient model testing.

## Area hierarchy

The `spectrum_region_code` field was updated from `0` to the values `10`, `11`, `12`.

## Spectrum files

### Base population

The base population and net migration were scaled in each file based on the proportions:

| Region   | Proportion | 
|: --------|------------|
| Northern | 13%        |
| Central  | 43%        |
| Southern | 44%        |

No other changes were made to demographic inputs. Fertility and non-HIV mortality rates were retained at national values.


### Number on ART

The number on ART was scaled by the proportions:

| Region   | Proportion | 
|: --------|------------|
| Northern | 10%        |
| Central  | 29%        |
| Southern | 61%        |

The same proportions were used for adults on ART, children on ART, and children receiving cotrimoxazole

### PMTCT and ANC clients

PMTCT and ANC clients were scaled 


| Region   | Clients    | Known Positive | ANC tested | Tested positive | PMTCT |
|: --------|------------|----------------|------------|-----------------|-------|
| Northern | 13%        | 8%             | 12%        | 8%              | 8%    |
| Central  | 43%        | 26%            | 42%		  | 28%				| 27%   |
| Southern | 44%        | 66%            | 46%		  | 64%				| 65%   |

### EPP fitting

EPP was refit single region in each file.

Analysis was done using the Spectrum v5.87 and based from the 2019 Malawi Spectrum file.
